To increase the accuracy and efficiency of communication, specific communication protocols have been developed. However, the current teaching of communication protocols remains in the theoretical realm, lack of effective training methods and practice environment. The purpose of this research is to assist communication training in healthcare professional education. We begin by designing communication tasks and collecting conversations on real-world handover cases. Then we propose Heallo – a computer conversational system that provides simulated scenarios for healthcare communication tasks. Specifically, Heallo converses with the user in a simulated communication task, assuming the role of the receiver. After the conversation, it will analyze the entire communication history and generate a detailed evaluation report based on the communication protocol. Heallo has received positive responses from healthcare professionals and has been incorporated into a hospital training program.","tags":null,"title":"Heallo: Conversational System for Communication Training in Healthcare Professional Education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruce X.B.

If performed effectively, HAE based on skeleton data can be used to monitor the outcomes of behavioral therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this paper, we propose a two-task graph convolutional network (2T-GCN) to represent skeleton data for HAE tasks involving abnormality detection and quality evaluation. The network is first evaluated using the UI-PRMD dataset and demonstrates accurate abnormality detection. Regarding quality evaluation, in addition to laboratory-collected UI-PRMD data, we test the network on a set of real exercise data collected from patients with AD. A numerical score indicating the degree to which actions deviate from normal is taken to reflect the severity of AD; thus, we apply 2T-GCN to determine such scores. Experimental results show that numerical scores for certain exercises performed by patients with AD are consistent with their AD severity level as identified by clinical staff. This corroboration highlights the potential of our approach for monitoring AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Skeleton-based Human Action Evaluation Using Graph Convolutional Network for Monitoring Alzheimer's Progression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruce X.B.

With the wide usage of depth sensors like Kinect, multimodal information including skeleton and RGB modalities brings a promising way to improve the performance.

In this paper, we propose a Teacher-Student Multimodal Fusion (TSMF) model1 that fuses the skeleton and RGB modalities at the model level for indoor action recognition. In our TSMF, we utilize a teacher network to transfer the structural knowledge of the skeleton modality to a student network for the RGB modality. With extensive experiments on two benchmarking datasets: NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD, results show that the proposed TSMF consistently performs better than state-of-the-art single modal and multimodal methods.

Current ADL-related research is based on data collected with help from non-elderly subjects in laboratory environments and the activities performed are predetermined for the sole purpose of data collection. To obtain more realistic datasets for the application, we recorded ADLs for the elderly with data collected from real-world environment involving real elderly subjects. Motivated by the need to collect data for more effective research related to elderly care, we chose to collect data in the room of an elderly person. Specifically, we installed Kinect, a vision-based sensor on the ceiling, to capture the activities that the elderly subject performs in the morning every day. Based on the data, we identified 12 morning activities that the elderly person performs daily. To recognize these activities, we created a HARELCARE framework to investigate into the effectiveness of existing Human Activity Recognition (HAR) algorithms and propose the use of a transfer learning algorithm for HAR. We compared the performance, in terms of accuracy, and training progress. Although the collected dataset is relatively small, the proposed algorithm has a good potential to be applied to all daily routine activities for healthcare purposes such as evidence-based diagnosis and treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Vision Based Daily Routine Recognition for Healthcare with Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruce X.B.

These heterogeneous sensors are usually used independently to conduct HAR. However, there are few comprehensive studies in the previous literature that investigate the HAR capability of various sensors and examine the gap between the existing HAR methods and their potential application domains. To fill in such a research gap, this survey unfastens the motivation behind HAR and compares the capability of various sensors for HAR by presenting their corresponding datasets and main algorithmic status. To do so, we first introduce HAR sensors from three categories: vision, ambient and wearable by elaborating their available tools and representative benchmark datasets. Then we analyze the HAR capability of various sensors regarding the levels of activities that we defined for indicating the activity complexity or resolution. With a comprehensive understanding of the different sensors, we review HAR algorithms from perspectives of single modal to multimodal methods. According to the investigated algorithms, we direct the future research on multimodal HAR solutions. This survey provides a panorama view of HAR sensors, human activity characteristics and HAR algorithms, which will serve as a source of references for developing sensor-based HAR systems and applications.","tags":null,"title":"A Survey of Sensor Modalities for Human Activity Recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Lu","Bruce X.B.

In this article, we propose a novel algorithm that can be used for computing the 3-D coordinates of a suture thread in knot tying. After proper training with our data set, we built a deep-learning model for accurately locating the suture’s tip. By applying a Hessian-based filter with multiscale parameters, the environmental noises can be eliminated while preserving the suture thread information. A multistencils fast marching method was then employed to segment the suture thread, and a precise stereomatching algorithm was implemented to compute the 3-D coordinates of this thread. Experiments associated with the precision of the deep-learning model, the robustness of the 2-D segmentation approach, and the overall accuracy of 3-D coordinate computation of the suture thread were conducted in various scenarios, and the results quantitatively validate the feasibility and reliability of the entire scheme for automated 3-D shape reconstruction.","tags":null,"title":"A Learning Approach for Suture Thread Detection with Feature Enhancement and Segmentation for 3-D Shape Reconstruction","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
