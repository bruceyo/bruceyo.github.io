  Recently, some skeleton-based physical therapy
  systems have been attempted to automatically evaluate
  the correctness or quality of an exercise performed
  by rehabilitation subjects. However, in
  terms of algorithms and evaluation criteria, the
  task remains not fully explored regarding making
  full use of different skeleton features. To advance
  the prior work, we propose a learning framework
  called Ensemble-based Graph Convolutional Network
  (EGCN) for skeleton-based rehabilitation exercise
  assessment. As far as we know, this is the
  first attempt that utilizes both two skeleton feature
  groups and investigates different ensemble strategies
  for the task. We also examine the properness
  of existing evaluation criteria and focus on evaluating
  the prediction ability of our proposed method.
  We then conduct extensive cross-validation experiments
  on two latest public datasets: UI-PRMD and
  KIMORE. Results indicate that the model-level ensemble
  scheme of our EGCN achieves better performance
  than existing methods. Code is available:
