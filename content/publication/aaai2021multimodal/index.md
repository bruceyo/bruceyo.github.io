abstract: "Indoor action recognition plays an important role in modern society,
  such as intelligent healthcare in large mobile cabin hospitals. With the wide
  usage of depth sensors like Kinect, multimodal information including skeleton
  and RGB modalities brings a promising way to improve the performance. However,
  existing methods are either focusing on a single data modality or failed to
  take the advantage of multiple data modalities. In this paper, we propose a
  Teacher-Student Multimodal Fusion (TSMF) model1 that fuses the skeleton and
  RGB modalities at the model level for indoor action recognition. In our TSMF,
  we utilize a teacher network to transfer the structural knowledge of the
  skeleton modality to a student network for the RGB modality. With extensive
  experiments on two benchmarking datasets: NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD, results show
  that the proposed TSMF consistently performs better than state-of-the-art
  single modal and multimodal methods. It also indicates that our TSMF could not
  only improve the accuracy of the student network but also significantly
  improve the ensemble accuracy."
