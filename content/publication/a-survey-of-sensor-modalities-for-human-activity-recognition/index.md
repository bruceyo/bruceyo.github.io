abstract: "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been attempted by various sensor
  modalities like vision sensors, ambient sensors, and wearable sensors. These
  heterogeneous sensors are usually used independently to conduct HAR. However,
  there are few comprehensive studies in the previous literature that
  investigate the HAR capability of various sensors and examine the gap between
  the existing HAR methods and their potential application domains. To fill in
  such a research gap, this survey unfastens the motivation behind HAR and
  compares the capability of various sensors for HAR by presenting their
  corresponding datasets and main algorithmic status. To do so, we first
  introduce HAR sensors from three categories: vision, ambient and wearable by
  elaborating their available tools and representative benchmark datasets. Then
  we analyze the HAR capability of various sensors regarding the levels of
  activities that we defined for indicating the activity complexity or
  resolution. With a comprehensive understanding of the different sensors, we
  review HAR algorithms from perspectives of single modal to multimodal methods.
  According to the investigated algorithms, we direct the future research on
  multimodal HAR solutions. This survey provides a panorama view of HAR sensors,
  human activity characteristics and HAR algorithms, which will serve as a
  source of references for developing sensor-based HAR systems and
  applications."
