abstract: "Human action recognition (HAR) in RGB-D videos has been widely
  investigated since the release of affordable depth sensors. Currently,
  unimodal approaches (e.g., skeleton-based and RGB video-based) have realized
  substantial improvements with increasingly larger datasets. However,
  multimodal methods specifically with model-level fusion have seldom been
  investigated. In this paper, we propose a model-based multimodal network
  (MMNet) that fuses skeleton and RGB modalities via a model-based approach. The
  objective of our method is to improve ensemble recognition accuracy by
  effectively applying mutually complementary information from different data
  modalities. For the model-based fusion scheme, we use a spatiotemporal graph
  convolution network for the skeleton modality to learn attention weights that
  will be transferred to the network of the RGB modality. Extensive experiments
  are conducted on five benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120,
  PKU-MMD, Northwestern-UCLA Multiview, and Toyota Smarthome. Upon aggregating
  the results of multiple modalities, our method is found to outperform
  state-of-the-art approaches on six evaluation protocols of the five datasets;
  thus, the proposed MMNet can effectively capture mutually complementary
  features in different RGB-D video modalities and provide more discriminative
  features for HAR. We also tested our MMNet on an RGB video dataset Kinetics
  400 that contains more outdoor actions, which shows consistent results with
  those of RGB-D video datasets."
