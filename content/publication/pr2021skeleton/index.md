abstract: Human action evaluation (HAE) involves judgments about the abnormality
  and quality of human actions. If performed effectively, HAE based on skeleton
  data can be used to monitor the outcomes of behavioral therapies for
  Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). In this paper, we propose a two-task graph
  convolutional network (2T-GCN) to represent skeleton data for HAE tasks
  involving abnormality detection and quality evaluation. The network is first
  evaluated using the UI-PRMD dataset and demonstrates accurate abnormality
  detection. Regarding quality evaluation, in addition to laboratory-collected
  UI-PRMD data, we test the network on a set of real exercise data collected
  from patients with AD. A numerical score indicating the degree to which
  actions deviate from normal is taken to reflect the severity of AD; thus, we
  apply 2T-GCN to determine such scores. Experimental results show that
  numerical scores for certain exercises performed by patients with AD are
  consistent with their AD severity level as identified by clinical staff. This
  corroboration highlights the potential of our approach for monitoring AD and
  other neurodegenerative diseases.
