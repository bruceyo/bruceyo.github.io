Dr. Bruce X.B. Yu joined ZJU-UIUC Institute as an Assistant Professor in January 2024. Before joining the institute, he served as a Post-doc Fellow in [Prof. Chang Wen Chen](https://chenlab.comp.polyu.edu.hk/)'s group at the Department of Computing of Hong Kong Polytechnic University where he earned his Ph.D. in September 2020 under the supervision of [Dr. Yan Liu](https://web.comp.polyu.edu.hk/csyliu/) and [Prof. Keith C.C. Chan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=QboxUKcAAAAJ). His research expertise spans across big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and image/video processing. His primary research topic is vision-based human behavior understanding, leading to publications on top venues such as TPAMI, Pattern Recognition, ICCV, AAAI, and IJCAI. His research outcomes also get international recognition such as best paper and best presentation awards. He has been actively conducting interdisciplinary research through various application-oriented projects, leading to publications on top venues such as IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, and Tourism Management. Besides application-driven research, he also works on fundamental research problems such as 3D human pose reconstruction, multimodal data/sensor fusion, and efficient transfer learning.
